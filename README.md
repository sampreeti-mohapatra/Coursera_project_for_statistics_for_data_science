# Statistics for Data Science - Coursera Project (Pragati Cohort 7 by Infosys Springboard) 

## Overview
This repository contains my project completed as part of the Coursera course "Statistics for Data Science" under the Pragati Cohort 7 program.  
The project focuses on exploring foundational statistical concepts and their applications in data analysis using Python.

## Objectives
- Understand statistical principles relevant to data science.
- Analyze and summarize real-world datasets using descriptive statistics.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships.
- Perform hypothesis testing and interpret results.
- Apply Python programming to implement statistical techniques.

## Tools and Technologies
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Platform: Coursera

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Descriptive analysis (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)  
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)  
- Correlation and covariance study  
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests)  
- Drawing insights and conclusions from datasets

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened understanding of statistical analysis in data science
- Improved practical Python skills for data-driven projects
- Ability to interpret results to support decision-making based on data

## Acknowledgment
This project was developed as part of the Pragati Cohort 7 by Infosys SpringBoard initiative, aimed at empowering learners through industry-aligned coursework and applied learning experiences.
